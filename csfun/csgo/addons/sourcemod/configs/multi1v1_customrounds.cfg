// In this file you can define some new custom round types.
// To enable the scout round example below, change the "enabled" setting from 0 to 1.
// If a round type should not affect a player's rating set "ranked" to 0.
// If a round type should not have its own rating value, you can remove the "ratingFieldName"
//     key, or set it to the empty string "".
// The "optional" key refers to it players have a choice whether the enable/disable it.
//
// You can also use the weapon names "rifle_preference" and "pistol_preference" in the
// list of weapons, and the players will get the rifle or pistol they have selected.
